# C GBA Raycaster  project

Purpose : Trying to make Raycaster on GBA.

## Getting Started

I always loves to play DOOM or those FPS/Dungeon Crawler using Raycasting.
I wanted to make a Raycaster game on GBA because I love so much this console.
This is NOT finished, just a test of Raycaster on GBA. 

### Prerequisites

I developped for GBA.
You'll need to install mednafen (or any GBA emulator).

```
apt-get install mednafen
```

### Compile

You just have to run the Makefile

```
make
```

## Running the program

Launch the binary file

```
mednafen ray.gba
```

## How it works

For the moment the software is not finished. If you launch the program,
you'll get into a room with horribly orange color with raycaster.

If you press W, you can rotate the camera.
